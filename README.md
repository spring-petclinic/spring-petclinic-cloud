# Distributed version of the Spring PetClinic - adapted for Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-cloud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-cloud/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

This microservices branch was initially derived from the [microservices version](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices) to demonstrate how to split sample Spring application into [microservices](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html).
To achieve that goal we use Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker, Spring Cloud Config, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Resilience4j, Micrometer and the Eureka Service Discovery from the [Spring Cloud Netflix](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix) technology stack. While running on Kubernetes, some components (such as Spring Cloud Config and Eureka Service Discovery) are replaced with Kubernetes-native features such as config maps and Kubernetes DNS resolution.

This fork also demostrates the use of free distributed tracing with Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, which provides cloud-based monitoring of  Spring Boot applications with 5 days of history.

## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application

[See the presentation of the Spring Petclinic Framework version](http://fr.slideshare.net/AntoineRey/spring-framework-petclinic-sample-application)

[A blog bost introducing the Spring Petclinic Microsevices](http://javaetmoi.com/2018/10/architecture-microservices-avec-spring-cloud/) (french language)

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

## Compiling and pushing to Cloud Foundry

The samples below are using Tanzu Application Service (previously Pivotal Cloud Foundry) as the target Cloud Foundry deployment, some adjustments may be needed for other Cloud Foundry distributions.

Please make sure you have the latest `cf` cli installed: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html  
For more information on Tanzu Application Service, see: https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-10/overview/dev.html  
For a list of available Cloud Foundry distributions, see: https://www.cloudfoundry.org/certified-platforms/  
For local testing and development, you can use PCF Dev: https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-dev/  

This application uses Wavefront as a SaaS that can provide free Spring Boot monitoring and Open Tracing for your application. If you'd like to remove the Wavefront integration, please remove the `wavefront` user-provided service reference from [manifest.yml](./manifest.yml). 

Otherwise, generate a free wavefront token by running one of the apps, for example:

```bash
cd spring-petclinic-api-gateway
mvn spring-boot:run
```

You will see something like this in the logs:

```
A Wavefront account has been provisioned successfully and the API token has been saved to disk.

To share this account, make sure the following is added to your configuration:

	management.metrics.export.wavefront.api-token=2e41f7cf-1111-2222-3333-7397a56113ca
	management.metrics.export.wavefront.uri=https://wavefront.surf

Connect to your Wavefront dashboard using this one-time use link:
https://wavefront.surf/us/AAA4s5f8xJ9yD

```

You free account has now been created.

Create a user-provided service for Wavefront using the data above. For example:

```
cf cups -p '{"uri": "https://wavefront.surf", "api-token": "2e41f7cf-1111-2222-3333-7397a56113ca", "application-name": "spring-petclinic-cloudfoundry", "fremium": "true"}' wavefront
```
If your operator deployed the wavefront proxy in your Cloud Foundry environment, point the URI to the proxy instead. You can obtain the value of the IP and port by creating a service key of the wavefront proxy and viewing the resulting JSON file. 

Contine with creating the services and deploying the application's microservices. A sample is available at `scripts/deployToCloudFoundry.sh`. Note that some of the services' plans may be different in your environment, so please review before executing. For example, you want want to fork the [spring-petclinic-cloud-config](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-cloud-config.git) repository if you want to make changes to the configuration.

```
echo "Creating Required Services..."
{
  cf create-service -c '{ "git": { "uri": "https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-cloud-config.git", "periodic": true }, "count": 3 }' p.config-server standard config &
  cf create-service p.service-registry standard registry & 
  cf create-service p.mysql db-small customers-db &
  cf create-service p.mysql db-small vets-db &
  cf create-service p.mysql db-small visits-db &
  sleep 5
} &> /dev/null
until [ `cf service config | grep -c "succeeded"` -ge 1  ] && [ `cf service registry | grep -c "succeeded"` -ge 1  ] && [ `cf service customers-db | grep -c "succeeded"` -ge 1  ] && [ `cf service vets-db | grep -c "succeeded"` -ge 1  ] && [ `cf service visits-db | grep -c "succeeded"` -ge 1  ]
do
  echo -n "."
done

mvn clean package -Pcloud
cf push --no-start

cf add-network-policy api-gateway --destination-app vets-service --protocol tcp --port 8080
cf add-network-policy api-gateway --destination-app customers-service --protocol tcp --port 8080
cf add-network-policy api-gateway --destination-app visits-service --protocol tcp --port 8080

cf start vets-service & cf start visits-service & cf start customers-service & cf start api-gateway &
```

You can now access your application by querying the route for the `api-gateway`:

```
âœ— cf apps
Getting apps in org pet-clinic / space pet-clinic as user@email.com...
OK

name                requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
api-gateway         started           1/1         1G       1G     api-gateway.apps.mysite.com
customers-service   started           1/1         1G       1G     customers-service.apps.internal
vets-service        started           1/1         1G       1G     vets-service.apps.internal
visits-service      started           1/1         1G       1G     visits-service.apps.internal

```

Access your route (like `api-gateway.apps.mysite.com` above) to see the application.

Access the one-time URL you received when bootstraping Wavefront to see Zipkin traces and other monitoring of your microservices:

![Wavefront dashboard screen](./docs/wavefront-summary.png)

Since we've included `brave.mysql8` in our `pom.xml`, the traces even show the various DB queries traces:

![Wavefront dashboard screen](./docs/wavefront-traces.png)



## Compiling and pushing to Kubernetes

This get a little bit more complicated when deploying to Kubernetes, since we need to manage Docker images, exposing services and more yaml. But we can pull through!

### Choose your Docker registry

You need to define your target Docker registry. Make sure you're already logged in by running `docker login <endpoint>` or `docker login` if you're just targeting Docker hub.

Setup an env variable to target your Docker registry. If you're targeting Docker hub, simple provide your username, for example:

```bash
export REPOSITORY_PREFIX=odedia
```

For other Docker registries, provide the full URL to your repository, for example:

```bash
export REPOSITORY_PREFIX=harbor.myregistry.com/demo
```

One of the neat features in Spring Boot 2.3 is that it can leverage [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) and [Paketo Buildpacks](https://paketo.io) to build production-ready images for us. Since we also configured the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` to use `layers`, we'll get optimized layering of the various components that build our Spring Boot app for optimal image caching. What this means in practice is that if we simple change a line of code in our app, it would only require us to push the layer containing our code and not the entire uber jar. To build all images and pushing them to your registry, run:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:build-image -Pk8s -DREPOSITORY_PREFIX=${REPOSITORY_PREFIX} && ./scripts/pushImages.sh
```

Since these are standalone microservices, you can also `cd` into any of the project folders and build it indivitually (as well as push it to the registry).

You should now have all your images in your Docker registry. It might be good to make sure you can see them available.

Make sure you're targeting your Kubernetes cluster.

Docker images for kubernetes have been published into DockerHub in the [springcommunity](https://hub.docker.com/u/springcommunity)
organization. You can pull an image:
```
docker pull springcommunity/spring-petclinic-cloud-discovery-service
```

### Setting things up in Kubernetes

Create the `spring-petclinic` namespace for Spring petclinic:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/init-namespace/ 
```

Create a Kubernetes secret to store the URL and API Token of Wavefront (replace values with your own real ones):

```bash
kubectl create secret generic wavefront -n spring-petclinic --from-literal=wavefront-url=https://wavefront.surf --from-literal=wavefront-api-token=2e41f7cf-1111-2222-3333-7397a56113ca
```

Create the Wavefront proxy pod, and the various Kubernetes services that will be used later on by our deployments:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/init-services
```

Verify the services are available:

```bash
âœ— kubectl get svc -n spring-petclinic
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
api-gateway         LoadBalancer   10.7.250.24    <pending>     80:32675/TCP        36s
customers-service   ClusterIP      10.7.245.64    <none>        8080/TCP            36s
vets-service        ClusterIP      10.7.245.150   <none>        8080/TCP            36s
visits-service      ClusterIP      10.7.251.227   <none>        8080/TCP            35s
wavefront-proxy     ClusterIP      10.7.253.85    <none>        2878/TCP,9411/TCP   37s
```

Verify the wavefront proxy is running:

```bash
âœ— kubectl get pods -n spring-petclinic
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
wavefront-proxy-dfbd4b695-fdd6t   1/1     Running   0          36s

```

### Settings up databases with helm

We'll now need to deploy our databases. For that, we'll use helm. You'll need helm 3 and above since we're not using Tiller in this deployment.

Make sure you have a single `default` StorageClass in your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
âœ— kubectl get sc
NAME                 PROVISIONER            AGE
standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd   6h11m

```

Deploy the databases:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm install vets-db-mysql bitnami/mysql --namespace spring-petclinic --version 8.8.8 --set auth.database=service_instance_db
helm install visits-db-mysql bitnami/mysql --namespace spring-petclinic  --version 8.8.8 --set auth.database=service_instance_db
helm install customers-db-mysql bitnami/mysql --namespace spring-petclinic  --version 8.8.8 --set auth.database=service_instance_db
```

### Deploying the application

Our deployment YAMLs have a placeholder called `REPOSITORY_PREFIX` so we'll be able to deploy the images from any Docker registry. Sadly, Kubernetes doesn't support environment variables in the YAML descriptors. We have a small script to do it for us and run our deployments:

```bash
./scripts/deployToKubernetes.sh
```

Verify the pods are deployed:

```bash
âœ— kubectl get pods -n spring-petclinic 
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
api-gateway-585fff448f-q45jc         1/1     Running   0          4m20s
customers-db-mysql-0                 1/1     Running   0          11m
customers-service-5d7d686654-kpcmx   1/1     Running   0          4m19s
vets-db-mysql-0                      1/1     Running   0          11m
vets-service-85cb8677df-l5xpj        1/1     Running   0          4m2s
visits-db-mysql-0                    1/1     Running   0          11m
visits-service-654fffbcc7-zj2jw      1/1     Running   0          4m2s
wavefront-proxy-dfbd4b695-fdd6t      1/1     Running   0          14m
```

Get the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the API Gateway:

```bash
âœ— kubectl get svc -n spring-petclinic api-gateway 
NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)        AGE
api-gateway   LoadBalancer   10.7.250.24   34.1.2.22   80:32675/TCP   18m
```

You can now browse to that IP in your browser and see the application running.

You should also see monitoring and traces from Wavefront under the application name `spring-petclinic-k8s`:

![Wavefront dashboard screen](./docs/wavefront-k8s.png)



## Starting services locally without Docker

Every microservice is a Spring Boot application and can be started locally using IDE 
or with the `../mvnw spring-boot:run -Plocal` command.
Remember to enable the `local` Maven profile.
Please note that supporting services (Config and Discovery Server) must be started before any other application (Customers, Vets, Visits and API).
Startup of Tracing server, Admin server, Grafana and Prometheus is optional.
If everything goes well, you can access the following services at given location:

* Discovery Server - http://localhost:8761
* Config Server - http://localhost:8888
* AngularJS frontend (API Gateway) - http://localhost:8080
* Customers, Vets and Visits Services - random port, check Eureka Dashboard 
* Tracing Server (Zipkin) - http://localhost:9411/zipkin/ (we use [openzipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-server))
* Admin Server (Spring Boot Admin) - http://localhost:9090
* Grafana Dashboards - http://localhost:3000
* Prometheus - http://localhost:9091

You can tell Config Server to use your local Git repository by using `native` Spring profile and setting
`GIT_REPO` environment variable, for example:
`-Dspring.profiles.active=native -DGIT_REPO=/projects/spring-petclinic-microservices-config`

## Starting services locally with docker-compose

In order to start entire infrastructure using Docker, you have to build images by executing `./mvnw clean install -P buildDocker` 
from a project root. Once images are ready, you can start them with a single command
`docker-compose up`. Containers startup order is coordinated with [`dockerize` script](https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize). 
After starting services it takes a while for API Gateway to be in sync with service registry,
so don't be scared of initial Spring Cloud Gateway timeouts. You can track services availability using Eureka dashboard
available by default at http://localhost:8761.

The `master` branch uses an  Alpine linux  with JRE 8 as Docker base. You will find a Java 11 version in the `release/java11` branch.

*NOTE: Under MacOSX or Windows, make sure that the Docker VM has enough memory to run the microservices. The default settings
are usually not enough and make the `docker-compose up` painfully slow.*


## In case you find a bug/suggested improvement for Spring Petclinic Microservices

Our issue tracker is available here: https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-cloud/issues

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which gets populated at startup with data.
A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed.
Dependency for Connector/J, the MySQL JDBC driver is already included in the `pom.xml` files.

### Start a MySql database

You may start a MySql database with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```
or download and install the MySQL database (e.g., MySQL Community Server 5.7 GA), which can be found here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

### Use the Spring 'mysql' profile

To use a MySQL database, you have to start 3 microservices (`visits-service`, `customers-service` and `vets-services`)
with the `mysql` Spring profile. Add the `--spring.profiles.active=mysql` as programm argument.

By default, at startup, database schema will be created and data will be populated.
You may also manually create the PetClinic database and data by executing the `"db/mysql/{schema,data}.sql"` scripts of each 3 microservices. 
In the `application.yml` of the [Configuration repository], set the `initialization-mode` to `never`.

If you are running the microservices with Docker, you have to add the `mysql` profile into the (Dockerfile)[docker/Dockerfile]:
```
ENV SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE docker,mysql
```
In the `mysql section` of the `application.yml` from the [Configuration repository], you have to change 
the host and port of your MySQL JDBC connection string. 

## Custom metrics monitoring

Grafana and Prometheus are included in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration, and the public facing applications
have been instrumented with [MicroMeter](https://micrometer.io) to collect JVM and custom business metrics.

A JMeter load testing script is available to stress the application and generate metrics: [petclinic_test_plan.jmx](spring-petclinic-api-gateway/src/test/jmeter/petclinic_test_plan.jmx)

![Grafana metrics dashboard](docs/grafana-custom-metrics-dashboard.png)

### Using Prometheus

* Prometheus can be accessed from your local machine at http://localhost:9091

### Using Grafana with Prometheus

* An anonymous access and a Prometheus datasource are setup.
* A `Spring Petclinic Metrics` Dashboard is available at the URL http://localhost:3000/d/69JXeR0iw/spring-petclinic-metrics.
You will find the JSON configuration file here: [docker/grafana/dashboards/grafana-petclinic-dashboard.json]().
* You may create your own dashboard or import the [Micrometer/SpringBoot dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/4701) via the Import Dashboard menu item.
The id for this dashboard is `4701`.

### Custom metrics
Spring Boot registers a lot number of core metrics: JVM, CPU, Tomcat, Logback... 
The Spring Boot auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of requests handled by Spring MVC.
All those three REST controllers `OwnerResource`, `PetResource` and `VisitResource` have been instrumented by the `@Timed` Micrometer annotation at class level.

* `customers-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.owner`
  * @Timed: `petclinic.pet`
* `visits-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.visit`
